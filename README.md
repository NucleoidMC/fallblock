# Fallblock

Nucleoid's fallback server, written in Rust.

## Running

`cargo run --release`

or `cargo build --release` and then `target/release/fallblock`

## Repository contents

`sample_config.json` contains a sample configuration file for testing or to use as a template

`src/world/blocks.json` and `src/world/block_entities.json` contain block state and block entity ID mappings generated by the builtin Minecraft datagenerators.

`datagen_post.sh` is the shell script used to generate the `blocks.json` and `block_entities.json` in `src/world/`, assuming that the vanilla datagenerators have already been run in the respitory directory.

`blank.nbt` is a [map template](https://github.com/NucleoidMC/map-templates) that can be used for testing.

## TODO

- [ ] Status/server ping
- [ ] Velocity player information forwarding

## Other notes

[wiki.vg](https://wiki.vg/) was my go to source of information for implementing much of the Minecraft protocol, so go check them out <3
